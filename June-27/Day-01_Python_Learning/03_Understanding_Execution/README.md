# Understanding Execution

Python code execution involves the following steps:

1. **Writing Code**: Write your Python code in a file with a `.py` extension.
2. **Interpreting Code**: The Python interpreter reads and executes the code line by line.
3. **Running Code**: You can run the code by executing `python filename.py` in the terminal.

Python uses an interpreter, which means it executes the code line by line. This allows for interactive programming but also means syntax errors will halt execution immediately.
