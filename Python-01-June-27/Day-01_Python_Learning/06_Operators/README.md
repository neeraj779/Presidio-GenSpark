# Operators

Python supports several types of operators:

- Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, `//`
- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- Logical operators: `and (&&)`, `or (||)`, `not (!)`
- Assignment operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`
- Bitwise operators: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`


## Precedence and Associativity

The precedence and associativity of operators in Python are as follows:

- `()` (Parentheses) - Left to right
- `**` (Exponentiation) - Right to left
- `+`, `-` (Unary plus and minus) - Right to left
- `*`, `/`, `%`, `//` (Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Floor division) - Left to right
- `+`, `-` (Addition, Subtraction) - Left to right
- `<<`, `>>` (Bitwise shift operators) - Left to right
- `&` (Bitwise AND) - Left to right
- `^` (Bitwise XOR) - Left to right
- `|` (Bitwise OR) - Left to right
- `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` (Comparison operators) - Left to right
- `not` (Logical NOT) - Right to left
- `and` (Logical AND) - Left to right
- `or` (Logical OR) - Left to right
- `=` (Assignment) - Right to left
- `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=` (Assignment operators) - Right to left
